# wordpress-magic-link

*This should be considered an early alpha and not reployed to production or sites without extra protection*

A simple WordPress plugin that allows a user to request a "magic link" to login to a WordPress site with just their email address or username. 

This plugin is very sparse with feedback if there is an error or something doesn't match -- to help keep it obtuse and keep hackers guessing.

TO USE: add [request_magic_link] shortcode to a page where the user can request the magic link. Will display and process a form to allows the request.
